# About
This was a project I took on in order to explore the ins and outs of Node.js and Express.js. Whenever I take on a project I make an effort to create something that I myself would find useful. I had already built an application which interfaced with WealthSimple but this was a desktop application using Qt5. I felt like it would make much more sense to build this as a web application that ensures it can be used on many devices. Thus WealthSimpler was born.
